# Conway's Game of Life

## Description

This project is a grid-based game simulation involving two players. The grid is represented as a dictionary, with each cell having values that indicate different states, such as `0` for empty, `1` for player 1, and `2` for player 2. The game includes functions for creating a blank grid, advancing generations, checking game rules, and allowing players to interact with the grid by making moves.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Players can destroy and add cells based on rules.
- **Generational Advancement**: The game advances through generations where the state of the grid evolves based on neighboring cells.
- **Pattern Loader**: Load preset patterns onto the grid.
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Each player takes turns destroying and adding cells.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- Uses basic libraries like `time` and `copy`.

## Gameplay

- The game starts with an empty grid.
- Players take turns destroying and adding cells.
- The game advances through generations according to a set of rules based on neighboring cells.
  
## Code Overview

- **`createBlankGrid(rows, columns)`**: Generates a grid with all cells initialized to `0`.
- **`printGrid(grid, rows, column)`**: Prints the current state of the grid to a file (`grid.txt`), which is then displayed in the console.
- **`advanceByGeneration(grid, row, column, player)`**: Advances the grid based on the gameâ€™s rules.
- **`turn(grid, player, rows, columns)`**: Handles player turns, including destroying and adding cells.
- **`neighborfinder(cell, grid, rows, columns)`**: Finds neighboring cells around a given cell.
- **`end(grid, player, row, col)`**: Checks if the game has ended based on the grid state.

## Pattern Loader

The game allows loading a predefined pattern of cells to jump-start the gameplay. Patterns are stored in `.txt` files and can be loaded onto the grid.

Example pattern file:

```txt
[1, 2]
[2, 3]
